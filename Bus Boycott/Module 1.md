---

### **Slide 2: Objectives**

### **Slide 3: Historical Context**
**Script:**  
"To understand the Montgomery Bus Boycott, we must first delve into the broader historical context.  
- Jim Crow laws enforced segregation and systematically oppressed Black citizens.  
- In 1954, the landmark case of *Brown v. Board of Education* declared segregation in public schools unconstitutional. This decision inspired hope and momentum for change.  
- The brutal murder of Emmett Till in 1955 exposed the horrors of racial violence, galvanizing a national outcry for justice."

### **Slide 4: The Baton Rouge Boycott**
**Script:**  
"The Baton Rouge Boycott of 1953 served as a critical precursor to Montgomery. Faced with segregated bus systems, the Black community in Baton Rouge organized alternative transportation methods, such as carpools, laying the groundwork for future movements."

[Visual cue: Show archival footage and add an interactive timeline linking Baton Rouge and Montgomery.]

### **Slide 5: Leadership and Community**
**Script:**  
"The Montgomery Bus Boycott was a collective effort, spearheaded by determined individuals and organizations.  
- The Women’s Political Council, led by Jo Ann Robinson, was instrumental in organizing the boycott.  
- Earlier in 1955, Claudette Colvin, a 15-year-old, refused to relinquish her bus seat, showing the power of youth in activism.  
- Rosa Parks, trained in strategic resistance at the Highlander Folk School, became the spark that ignited the movement."

[Visual cue: Show images of Jo Ann Robinson, Claudette Colvin, and Rosa Parks with their achievements listed.]

### **Slide 6: Rosa Parks and the Spark**
**Script:**  
"On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger. Her quiet act of defiance became a loud call to action. The Women’s Political Council responded immediately, distributing 50,000 leaflets to mobilize the community."

[Visual cue: Display Rosa Parks’ arrest report and a scanned image of the WPC leaflet.]

### **Slide 7: Planning the Boycott**
**Script:**  
"The success of the boycott relied on meticulous planning.  
- The Montgomery Improvement Association, led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., coordinated efforts.  
- Alternative transportation systems, such as carpools and walking groups, ensured the community could function without buses.  
- Churches, schools, and workplaces became hubs for organizing and support."
